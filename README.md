# Introduction
I Wrote This Project Only For Fun And Practise Purpose. Its Just To Practically Implement Udacity Project Code In Real Life. You can Directly Read Project Codes 
Line By Line and Read Comments for more details. 

# Implementation Idea
- Client, Server Architecture.
- Laptop/Desktop as Server
- Raspberry Pi as client.
- TOY Car Controlled By RaspBerry GPIO Pins
- Camera Module Also Attached With Toy Car As Front Camera.

# Idea (Codes Available)
- Used OpenCV as Image Processing library
- Numpy for Image Processing
- Python Socket module as network
- Established Wifi Network Between Raspberry Pi and Laptop
- Then, Live Stream Images From Client To Server Through Network
- Server Will Process Image And Send Back Command For Toy Car Movements
- Raspberry Received Command, GPIO signals sent.

# Future Plan
- Add A Neural Network To Make Car Movement More Smooth.
- Add More Features
- Add More stability 

# Want to Contribute
- Come, Start Now
- For Info, Check Comments, Codes, DevelopmentPlanning.ReadMe File
- Contact Me, For More Details.

# Forgive Me
Forgive Me If I have Done Anything Wrong implementation In This Code Because I'm very new guy in this feild. So, Forgive me and Don't Forget To Notify me My Mistake. It will be very Apricatable.

# Hardware (I Used Below Various Hardware Gadgets Like)
- A Raspberry Pi Board
- Power Bank
- Rasp Camera Module
- Toy RC Car
- Motor Controller
- Little Bit Of Hardware Up/Down
- Assembled All Together
- Laptop As Server


### Todos

 - Add More Feature
 - Make It More Easy To Use And Light Weight
